##🚀 MNEE-Loan AI Terminal:

The New Standard for Programmable Debt & Automated Financial Settlements.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##📖 Overview:

MNEE-Loan AI is a next-generation banking terminal designed to bridge the gap between static, manual loan documentation and the future of autonomous finance. By transforming complex loan contracts into a unified LoanJSON standard, our platform enables AI Agents and Smart Contracts to execute automated debt settlements using the MNEE Stablecoin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##🔴 The Problem:

The traditional loan market is broken:

Manual Processing: Billions are spent on human review of PDF/Paper contracts.

Data Silos: Every bank speaks a different "data language," making secondary trading impossible.

Settlement Latency: Loan disbursements and repayments take days to settle via traditional rails (SWIFT).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


##✅ Our Solution: The Triple-Layer Framework:

Instruction Layer (LoanJSON AI): We use Google's Gemini-powered AI to extract and standardize loan covenants into a machine-readable JSON format.

Execution Layer (MNEE Stablecoin): We use the MNEE USD-backed stablecoin (Contract: 0x8ccedbAe4916b79da7F3F612EfB2EB93A2bFD6cF) to power programmable payments.

Settlement Layer (Smart Contracts): Payments are auto-triggered based on the LoanJSON parameters, ensuring zero-manual intervention.

##🛠 Key Features:

AI-Powered Ingestion: Upload PDF loan agreements and get instant JSON standardization.

MNEE Native Terminal: Real-time wallet tracking and stablecoin balance management.

Smart Settlement Dashboard: Visual timeline of automated repayments scheduled on the Ethereum blockchain.

Institutional UI: A high-performance Dark-Mode terminal inspired by Bloomberg, optimized for banking professionals.

Programmable JSON Payloads: View and copy blockchain-ready payloads for any loan transaction.

##💻 Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.

AI Engine: Google Gemini (LoanJSON Standard).

Web3: MNEE Stablecoin (Ethereum/L2s).

Deployment: Vercel / v0.dev.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



##🚀 How it Works:

Standardize: A raw loan document is converted into LoanJSON.

Program: The JSON dictates the rules (Amount, Due Date, Interest).

Settle: The MNEE Smart Contract executes the payment automatically on the due date.
